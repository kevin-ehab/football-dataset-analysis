# ⚽football-dataset-analysis

This project is part of the **Investigate a Dataset** challenge. It analyzes a European soccer database to explore patterns and answer key questions about league performance and game outcomes.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes detailed information about soccer matches across multiple European leagues. Key features include:

- Country and League identifiers  
- Season and stage details  
- Match dates  
- Goals scored by home and away teams  
- Player identifiers  

## 🔍 Questions Investigated

The analysis focuses on answering the following:

- **Which league has the highest and lowest average goals per match?**
- **Which league has the highest and lowest percentage of drawn matches?**
- **Is there a correlation between home goals and away goals?**
- **Do home teams win significantly more than away teams?**

## 🛠️ Process

1. **Data Wrangling**  
   - Loaded and assessed the dataset  
   - Cleaned missing values and standardized data types

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized goals and draws by league  
   - Analyzed win/draw/loss trends for home vs away teams  

3. **Conclusions**  
   - Some leagues showed higher scoring and more home wins  
   - Correlation between home and away goals is weak but observable  

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Leagues differ significantly in match outcomes and goal distributions  
- Draws are more common in some leagues than others  
- Home advantage is a strong factor across most leagues
